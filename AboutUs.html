		<h1> About Us</h1>
			<p>
				Glenwood has been designing and manufacturing furniture in Ireland and the UK since 1980.
				The company has a strong family tradition and with over 35 years experience in the furniture 
				manufacturing industry, you can be assured of continuity, craftsmanship and high quality products.<br>
				A substantial proportion of Glenwood's team of furniture-makers has worked with the company for most of its
				existence, and it is common for more than one member of a local family to be represented in the workforce. 
				This strong family tradition has brought the stability of longstanding experience to our growing company. <br>
				Glenwood employs state of the art manufacturing techniques combined with hand finishing to produce high quality 
				competitively priced furniture.<br>
				We place a great deal of emphasis on the design of our products and take great care to produce and finish furniture 
				that is attractive, practical and great for you to touch and use
